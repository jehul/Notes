# Notes: Discussion CS131 Week 6

Prolog Tips and Tricks for the Homework.

Some Prolog built-ins:
     append(List1, List2, List_Result) : succeeds if the concatenetation of the lists results in List_Result
     Observations: notice how in Prolog we can just as easliy provide predicates with a List_Result and get back every combination of lists that result in List_Result. We can use predicates backwards, forwards, and in every direction in between!
